Some devices cannot upload files. According to [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/download#fileinput-inputtypes-setclasses) :
> iOS < 6 and some android version don't support this

File uploads are disabled for ancient IOS 5 devices. Please [add a support message](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/quick-mail) if uploads are disabled on your phone or tablet, so I can remove the upload button if your device is detected.

__Address Validation__

* Address validation is an option to check recipient domain on manually entered addresses.

* International (non-ASCII) domains must be converted to [punycode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) with [idn_to_ascii](http://php.net/manual/en/function.idn-to-ascii.php).


  Unfortunately, `idn_to_ascii` is not available on all systems.

* "Cannot verify international domains because idn_to_ascii function not found"

  This is displayed when Quick Mail cannot verify domains containing non-ASCII characters.

* [checkdnsrr](http://php.net/manual/en/function.checkdnsrr.php) is used to check a domain for an [MX record](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/postini/docs/admin/en/activate/mx_faq.html).


  An MX record tells senders how to send mail to the domain.

  `wp_mail` error messages are displayed, if there is a problem.

   `wp_mail` rejected an address. Seen when Quick Mail verification is off.
