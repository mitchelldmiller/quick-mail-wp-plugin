Minimum permission can be changed with an option or filter.\r\n\r\n__Limitations__\r\n\r\n* One recipient per email.\r\n\r\n* Up to 5 manually entered recipients are saved in HTML Storage.\r\n\r\n* Multiple files can be uploaded from up to 6 folders (directories).\r\n\r\n__Address Validation__\r\n\r\n* Address validation is an option to check recipient domain on manually entered addresses.\r\n\r\n* International (non-ASCII) domains must be converted to [punycode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492) with [idn_to_ascii](http://php.net/manual/en/function.idn-to-ascii.php).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately, `idn_to_ascii` is not available on all systems.\r\n\r\n* \"Cannot verify international domains because idn_to_ascii function not found\"\r\n\r\n  This is displayed when Quick Mail cannot verify domains containing non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\n* [checkdnsrr](http://php.net/manual/en/function.checkdnsrr.php) is used to check a domain for an [MX record](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/postini/docs/admin/en/activate/mx_faq.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n  An MX record tells senders how to send mail to the domain.\r\n\r\n__Mail Errors__\r\n\r\n* Quick Mail sends email with [wp_mail](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_mail/).\r\n\r\n\r\n  `wp_mail` error messages are displayed, if there is a problem.\r\n\r\n* \"You must provide at least one recipient email address.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   `wp_mail` rejected an address.
